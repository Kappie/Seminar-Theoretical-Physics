\section{One-dimensional charge density waves}

Materials in which the electron density $\rho(x)$ is modulated with a wave of
wavelength $\lambda = \frac{2\pi}{Q}$ are said to contain a charge density wave.
In this paper, we will treat a simple model for a one-dimensional chain of atoms containing such a charge density wave:

$$ H = -t \sum_x (c_x^{\dagger}c_{x+a} + c_x^{\dagger}c_{x-a}) + \sum_x (\mu + \Delta \cos(Qx + \phi))c_x^{\dagger}c_x $$

The first term describes hopping between sites, and the second term contains the chemical potential and the charge density wave.

It is important to notice that if $\lambda = n a$ with $n$ integer and $a$ the lattice spacing, the charge order is said to be commensurate, i.e. the charge modulation is neatly periodic in $n$ lattice sites. If $\lambda$ is not of this form, the charge order is called incommensurate.

After imposing periodic boundary conditions, commensurate charge order is the only option, and the total amount of lattice sites $N$ must equal a multiple of $\lambda$.

To diagonalize $H$, we first apply the canonical Fourier transform:

$$c_x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{0 \leq k \leq \frac{2\pi}{a}}e^{ikx}c_k$$

The hopping term and the chemical potential both give contributions diagonal in $k$. After writing $\cos(Qx + \phi) = \frac{1}{2}(e^{i(Qx + \phi)} + e^{-i(Qx + \phi)}) $, we see that the charge wave in real space gives an off-diagonal contribution $k$. The resulting Hamiltonian in Fourier space is:

$$ H = \sum_{0 \leq k \leq \frac{2\pi}{a}} (\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_k c_k^{\dagger}c_k + \Delta_\phi c_k^{\dagger}c_{k+Q} + \text{H.c.}) $$

Where $\epsilon_k = -2t \cos(ka) + \mu $ and $\Delta_\phi = \Delta e^{i\phi}$, i.e. $\Delta$ acquires a phase corresponding to the offset of the charge distribution.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Positioning Figures and Tables: Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation ÒFig. 1Ó, even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{An Example of a Table}
\label{table_example}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
\hline
One & Two\\
\hline
Three & Four\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

      \framebox{\parbox{3in}{We suggest that you use a text box to insert a graphic (which is ideally a 300 dpi TIFF or EPS file, with all fonts embedded) because, in an document, this method is somewhat more stable than directly inserting a picture.

       magnetic core versus DC bias magnetic field}

   \end{figure}


Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity ÒMagnetizationÓ, or ÒMagnetization, MÓ, not just ÒMÓ. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write ÒMagnetization (A/m)Ó or ÒMagnetization {A[m(1)]}Ó, not just ÒA/mÓ. Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write ÒTemperature (K)Ó, not ÒTemperature/K.Ó

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

A conclusion section is not required. Although a conclusion may review the main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest applications and extensions.

\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
