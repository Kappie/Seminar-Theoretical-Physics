\section{One-dimensional charge density waves}

Materials in which the electron density $\rho(x)$ is modulated with a wave of
wavelength $\lambda = \frac{2\pi}{Q}$ are said to contain a charge density wave.
In this paper, we will treat a simple model for a one-dimensional chain of atoms containing such a charge density wave:

\begin{align}\label{hamiltonian}
H = -t \sum_x (c_x^{\dagger}c_{x+a} + c_x^{\dagger}c_{x-a}) + \sum_x (\mu + \Delta \cos(Qx + \phi))c_x^{\dagger}c_x
\end{align}

The first term describes hopping between sites, and the second term contains the chemical potential and the charge density wave. From the fact that a band gap opens at $\mu$, it follows that $\mu = -2t\cos(\frac{Qa}{2})$.

If $\lambda = n a$ with $n$ integer and $a$ the lattice spacing, the charge order is said to be commensurate, i.e. the charge modulation is neatly periodic in $n$ lattice sites. Otherwise, the charge order is called incommensurate.

After imposing periodic boundary conditions, commensurate charge order is the only option, and the total amount of lattice sites $N$ must equal a multiple of $\lambda$.

To diagonalize $H$, we first apply the canonical Fourier transform:

$$c_x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{0 \leq k < \frac{2\pi}{a}}e^{ikx}c_k$$

The hopping term and the chemical potential both give contributions diagonal in $k$. After writing $\cos(Qx + \phi) = \frac{1}{2}(e^{i(Qx + \phi)} + e^{-i(Qx + \phi)}) $, we see that the charge wave in real space gives an off-diagonal contribution in $k$. The resulting Hamiltonian in Fourier space is:

$$ H = \sum_{0 \leq k < \frac{2\pi}{a}} (\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_k c_k^{\dagger}c_k + \Delta_\phi c_k^{\dagger}c_{k+Q} + \text{H.c.}) $$

Where $\epsilon_k = -2t \cos(ka) + \mu $ and $\Delta_\phi = \Delta e^{i\phi}$, i.e. $\Delta$ acquires a phase corresponding to the offset of the charge distribution.






\subsection{Matrix Form Hamiltonian}
We will take a few steps to put this Hamiltonian in Matrix form.
This will prove to be a more convinient way to perform numerical calculations.\\
First we group terms in the sum over $k$ into $q$ sums over $m$.

\begin{align*}
H &= \sum_{0 \leq k < \frac{2\pi}{a}} (\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_k c_k^{\dagger}c_k + \Delta_\phi c_k^{\dagger}c_{k+Q} + \text{H.c.})\\
&=\sum_{0 \leq k < \frac{2\pi}{qa}} \sum_{m=0}^{q-1}  (\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{k+\frac{2\pi m}{qa}} c_{k+\frac{2\pi m}{qa}}^{\dagger}c_{k+\frac{2\pi m}{qa}} + \Delta_\phi c_{k+\frac{2\pi m}{qa}}^{\dagger}c_{k+\frac{2\pi m}{qa}+Q} + \text{H.c.})\\
\end{align*}

Since our case is commensurate, we can express $Q=\frac{2\pi}{qa}$. Furthermore we can shift the sum over $m$ by 1,
since $k$ and $k+\frac{2\pi}{a}$ are equivalent points in $k$-space.

\begin{align*}
  &=\sum_{0 \leq k < Q} \sum_{p=1}^{q}  (\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{k+Qm} c_{k+Qm}^{\dagger}c_{k+Qm} + \Delta_\phi c_{k+Qm}^{\dagger}c_{k+Q(m+1)} + \text{H.c.})\\
  &=\sum_{0\leq k < Q} (c_{k+Q}^{\dagger},c_{k+2Q}^{\dagger},\dots,c_{k+qQ}^{\dagger})\tilde{H}_{k} (c_{k+Q},c_{k+2Q},\dots,c_{k+qQ})^{T} \\
\end{align*}

\begin{align}
\tilde{H}_{k}=\begin{bmatrix}
\epsilon_{k+Q}       & \Delta_\phi     & 0      & \hdots     & 0     & \Delta_\phi^*  \\
\Delta_\phi^*    & \epsilon_{k+2Q} & \Delta_\phi & 0 & \hdots     & 0 \\
0               & \Delta_\phi^* & \ddots & \ddots  &  &\vdots \\
\vdots   & 0 & \ddots &  &  &  0  \\
0 &  \vdots    &  &  &  & \Delta_{\phi} \\
\Delta_\phi & 0 &    \hdots          &0   & \Delta_{\phi}^{*}      & \epsilon_{k+qQ}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}




\section{Chern numbers and Electron transport}

Varying the phase of the CDW, does not necessarily transport the electrons along the chain.
The transport depends on the chemical potential.
For $\mu(Q=\frac{ap}{q}) = 0$, we have \textit{no} electron transport.
This corresponds to our Chern numbers being $0$.
This is in agreement with the calculations of section \textbf{???}.
The important connection to make is that the Chern numbers are antisymmetric at the same point as the chemical potential is.
This is the point for which the electron transport changes directions.
The antisymmetry of the Chern numbers is easily seen in the antisymmetry around $\frac{1}{2}$ of the colouring of the spectrum as a function of $\frac{p}{q}$ ie the Hofstadter Butterfly figure \textbf{???}.\\
The transport of electrons along the chain is analogous to the transport of electrons in the integer quantum Hall effect.
In the next subsection we look more carefully at this comparison.

\subsection{The Hofstadter Hamiltonian vs CDW}
The CDW spectrum is a Hofstadter butterfly \cite{hofstadter1976}. It turns out that the CDW is very similar to that where the butterfly originally arose.
So let's compare our real-space Hamiltonian to that of the tight-binding model on an isotropic square lattice under a vertical uniform magnetic field in $k$-space \cite{Yoshioka}:
$$
\mathcal{H}=-t\sum_{k_{x},k_{y}}(c_{1}^{\dagger}(\textbf{k}),c_{2}^{\dagger}(\textbf{k}),\dots,c_{q}^{\dagger}(\textbf{k}))\tilde{\mathcal{H}}_{k}(c_{1}(\textbf{k}),c_{2}(\textbf{k}),\dots,c_{q}(\textbf{k}))
$$
$$
\tilde{\mathcal{H}}_{k}=\begin{bmatrix}
E_{k_{y}+2\pi \Phi}      & 1     & 0      & \hdots     & 0     & e^{-iqk_{x}}  \\
1    &E_{k_{y}+4\pi \Phi} & 1 & 0 & \hdots     & 0 \\
0               & 1 & \ddots & \ddots  &  &\vdots \\
\vdots   & 0 & \ddots &  &  &  0  \\
0 &  \vdots    &  &  &  & 1 \\
e^{iqk_{x}} & 0 &    \hdots          &0   & 1      & E_{k_{y}+2\pi q\Phi}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

With $E_{k_{y}+2\pi m\Phi}=2\cos(k_{y}+2\pi m\Phi)$. Where $\Phi$ is in units of the magnetic flux quantum.

This is how to map this situation onto that of the CDW.

\begin{align*}
k_{y} &\leftrightarrow \phi  \\
\Phi &\leftrightarrow \frac{Q}{2\pi} \\
\end{align*}

The $x$-sum in the CDW case goes from sites 1 to $q$.
The length of the chain $q$ is the same as the length of the magnetic unit cells in the lattice.
The phase due to the flux in the lattice case gives us the complex exponential in the corners of our matrix.
Finally to make the mapping work we need to set $\Delta = 2t$ and $a=1$.


\section{Topological classification}

The charge density wave Hamiltonian in $k$-space can be divided in different
classes. Originally the classification was developed for translational or
rotational invariant systems, but because the dihedral group is the only
nontrivial space group another classification is made. When symmetries are taken
into account a topological classification can be made. If a system behaves in
the same way when time is reversed on can say that the system has a time
symmetry. For time symmetry there are 3 options. Either the system is not time
symmetric $(T=0)$, or it is time symmetric $(T^2=1)$ or the system is time
anti-symmetric  $(T^2=-1)$.  Another symmetry  is charge conjugation C. When
this is observed as particle-hole symmetry one can distinguish an occupation of
the hole or an empty hole. When there is a symmetry the  charge conjugation can
be plus $(C^2=1)$ or minus $(C^2=-1)$ and when there is no symmetry  the charge
conjugation number  is zero $(C=0)$.  Because both the time reversal operator T
and the charge conjugation number C are topological invariant their
multiplication $S=T * C $ is also a topological invariant. As a first guess one
would find $3 * 3 = 9 $ topological invariant sectors. But when there is no time
reversal $(T=0)$ and no charge conjugation $(C=0)$, S can have two values. When
a system is symmetric in the combination of time and particle hole symmetry S is
given the value of $1$. When it is not symmetric in the combination of them the
value is $0$. All together there are than $10$ different topological sectors
where S is an invariant. This Tenfold Way classifies the allowed topologies of
all gapped, disordeblack, quadratic fermion theories into ten classes based on the
dimension of the parameter space, see ???. The advantage of this classification is that
these sectors have edge states which are classified by a nonzero Chern number.
Because these edge states do not
depend on small perturbations in the bulk of the material it is possible to
measure variables at the edge that give information of the whole material.
To classify our Hamiltonian we see that there are no zero's on the diagonal,
which exclude the 3 chiral cases. Because the Hamiltonian can be expressed as a 2$\times$2
 matrix, exept in the case of half filling, the four Bogoliubov-de Gennes cases. From the three
 clases left, it must be the one where the Hamiltonian in $k$ space is complex.
 With this reasoning our Hamiltonian fall into the symmetry-free class.


\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Positioning Figures and Tables: Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation ÒFig. 1Ó, even at the beginning of a sentence.

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity ÒMagnetizationÓ, or ÒMagnetization, MÓ, not just ÒMÓ. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write ÒMagnetization (A/m)Ó or ÒMagnetization {A[m(1)]}Ó, not just ÒA/mÓ. Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write ÒTemperature (K)Ó, not ÒTemperature/K.Ó

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

A conclusion section is not requiblack. Although a conclusion may review the main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest applications and extensions.
