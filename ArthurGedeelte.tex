\section{Numerical calculations and results}
The numerical methods used to create the band structure and the butterfly are discussed here.
For this, the matrix \ref{eq:}, is vital.
The arguments of the matrix are $\{k,\phi,\Delta,Q,a\}$.
The mapping to the Hofstadter problem is used where $\Delta = 2t$ and $a = 1$, which is used for all numerical calculations.
The chemical potential is dependent on $Q$ and $a$, see \ref{eq:}.
As has been mentioned before, we look at cases were 
$\frac{Q a}{2 \pi} = \frac{p}{q}$, where $p \leq q$.
For numerical purposes, the matrix is scaled to the hopping parameter $t$, and so all matrix entries are divided by this parameter.
More scaling is achieved by setting $k$ to $qka$.
With this scaling the allowed energies, setting the chemical potential to zero, are between $-4$ and $4$.
For the scaled momenta, $k$, $0 \leq k \leq 2 \pi$.

The matrix has a size of $q$ by $q$ and diagonalizing it yields a spectrum of $q$ eigenvalues which might contain degenerate eigenvalues.
This diagonalization is only possible when all the parameters are fixed, changing any of the parameters might result in a different spectrum.

\subsection{Band structure}
When calculating the band structure, the value of $Q$ is fixed and $k$ is varied. 
The phase $\phi$ can also be varied, but is set to zero for convenience.
Every value of $k$ yields a matrix and in turn every matrix is diagonalized thus yielding an energy spectrum for every $k$.
Grouping these values correctly results in the band structure.

For the different values of 
$\frac{Q a}{2 \pi} \in \{2/3,3/5 \}$ the band structures are plotted in figure \ref{fig:bandstructure}.

Right:$p = 3$, $q = 5$ yielding Chern numbers, bottom to top, of 2, -1, 1, -2, 0. }
\end{figure}


\subsection{The CDW butterfly}
Mapping the charge density wave to the Hofstadter problem, and setting the chemical potential to zero, the Hofstadter butterfly is retrieved.
The butterfly can be constructed by fixing $k$ and $\phi$, while varying $Q$.
The relation $\frac{Q a}{2 \pi} = \frac{p}{q}$ must be obeyed however and for numerical calculations an upper limit on $q$ must be made.
The resulting values for $Q$ result from a list of fractions where 
$1 \leq p \leq q$ and all the fractions are reduced to the lowest term, making $p$ and $q$ coprime. 
The requirement of the fractions is that
$0 < \frac{p}{q} \leq 1$.
For a particular value of $\frac{p}{q}$, there are $q$ eigenvalues/bands, and so a list of fractions and energies is obtained.
With every band a Chern number is associated, which can be used to color the butterfly according to the Chern number.

\section{One-dimensional charge density waves}

Materials in which the electron density $\rho(x)$ is modulated with a wave of
wavelength $\lambda = \frac{2\pi}{Q}$ are said to contain a charge density wave.
In this paper, we will treat a simple model for a one-dimensional chain of atoms containing such a charge density wave:

$$ H = -t \sum_x (c_x^{\dagger}c_{x+a} + c_x^{\dagger}c_{x-a}) + \sum_x (\mu + \Delta \cos(Qx + \phi))c_x^{\dagger}c_x $$

The first term describes hopping between sites, and the second term contains the chemical potential and the charge density wave.

It is important to notice that if $\lambda = n a$ with $n$ integer and $a$ the lattice spacing, the charge order is said to be commensurate, i.e. the charge modulation is neatly periodic in $n$ lattice sites. If $\lambda$ is not of this form, the charge order is called incommensurate.

After imposing periodic boundary conditions, commensurate charge order is the only option, and the total amount of lattice sites $N$ must equal a multiple of $\lambda$.

To diagonalize $H$, we first apply the canonical Fourier transform:

$$c_x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{0 \leq k < \frac{2\pi}{a}}e^{ikx}c_k$$

The hopping term and the chemical potential both give contributions diagonal in $k$. After writing $\cos(Qx + \phi) = \frac{1}{2}(e^{i(Qx + \phi)} + e^{-i(Qx + \phi)}) $, we see that the charge wave in real space gives an off-diagonal contribution in $k$. The resulting Hamiltonian in Fourier space is:

$$ H = \sum_{0 \leq k < \frac{2\pi}{a}} (\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_k c_k^{\dagger}c_k + \Delta_\phi c_k^{\dagger}c_{k+Q} + \text{H.c.}) $$

Where $\epsilon_k = -2t \cos(ka) + \mu $ and $\Delta_\phi = \Delta e^{i\phi}$, i.e. $\Delta$ acquires a phase corresponding to the offset of the charge distribution.

Matrix:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\epsilon_k       & \Delta_\phi     & 1      &        & -1     & 2  \\
\Delta_\phi^*    & \epsilon_{k+Q} & \Delta_\phi & \ddots &        & -1 \\
-1               & \Delta_\phi^* & \ddots & \ddots &    \\
   & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & 1  \\
1  &        & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & -2 \\
-2 & 1      &        & -1     & 2      & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

\section{Bruno Stukje}
Let\'s rewrite this Hamiltonian in a nice Matrix form:
\begin{align*}
\hat{H} &= \sum_{0 \leq k < \frac{2\pi}{a}} (\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_k c_k^{\dagger}c_k + \Delta_\phi c_k^{\dagger}c_{k+Q} + \text{H.c.})\\
&=\sum_{0 \leq k < \frac{2\pi}{qa}} \sum_{p=0}^{q-1}  (\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{k+\frac{2\pi p}{qa}} c_{k+\frac{2\pi p}{qa}}^{\dagger}c_{k+\frac{2\pi p}{qa}} + \Delta_\phi c_{k+\frac{2\pi p}{qa}}^{\dagger}c_{k+\frac{2\pi p}{qa}+Q} + \text{H.c.})\\
\end{align*}


\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Positioning Figures and Tables: Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation ÒFig. 1Ó, even at the beginning of a sentence.

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity ÒMagnetizationÓ, or ÒMagnetization, MÓ, not just ÒMÓ. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write ÒMagnetization (A/m)Ó or ÒMagnetization {A[m(1)]}Ó, not just ÒA/mÓ. Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write ÒTemperature (K)Ó, not ÒTemperature/K.Ó

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

A conclusion section is not required. Although a conclusion may review the main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest applications and extensions.
